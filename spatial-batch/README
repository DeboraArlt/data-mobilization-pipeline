quick scripts for batch uploading/editing layers to the spatial portal

= prepare layer files and layers.csv

  environmental layers should be in EHdr format)
  (gdal_translate -of EHdr in out.bil; zip out.zip out.hdr out.prj out.bil*)

  make sure that all of your layers are described in layers.csv

= grab credentials

  sign in to the portal and add the values of the JSESSIONID and ALA-Auth
  cookies to config.py

= upload layers

  run upload.py
  this will run through layers.csv, upload the layers, and output a new csv
  file called managed.csv which contains each layer's spatial portal id

= add the metadata
  
  run manage.py to add the metadata for all "managed" layers and make
  the layers available for use
