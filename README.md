# Data mobilization pipeline

Various tools and examples to support reproducible workflows when migrating data or mobilizing data into various standard formats (.csv, DwC-A etc)

- sweref99-to-wgs84 - an example of synthesizing data using R and exposing the data as an API endpoint, also of how to convert coordinates between different projections and to display data from the earlier API on an interactive web map

- publish-dwca - an example of how to publish a collection of DwC-A files to GBIF through the registry API (using `reggie`) and storing the GBIF dataset IDs to avoid duplicate datasets
